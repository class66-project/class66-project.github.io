Last week saw the delivery of (and payment for - ouch!) the laser cut bogie parts.
It's only when seeing the side profiles that I appreciated the sheer size of these
bogies. They are long!

Standard metal parts were ordered earlier this week, and should arrive next week,
at which time we have all the material to start building the bogies. Then, it'll be
a matter of buying the off-the-shelf parts (bearings, springs, etc.) and I should be
able to construct a pair of bogies.

In the metal order for the other parts of the bogies, I also bought the material
for the chassis itself, so I should be able to start working on it in the near future.
I've already got the motors, controller, and battery, so I should then have a
working chassis. It'll look nothing like a 66 (as it won't have the roof), but it
will be the basis of the loco, with only the roof, buffers, electronics, lights...
(and so on) to put together to finish it off.
