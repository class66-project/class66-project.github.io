I was fortunate enough to come into the posession of a number of (empty!)
Great Whip canisters, which I intend to use as vacuum resevoirs. The resevoirs
I have seen in use most are drain pipes with custom end caps, which have a
habit of leaking, even with copius mounts of araldyte to seal the gaps.

For this reason, I always wanted to have metal canisters, and after a few
different thoughts and suggestions of what to use (fire extinguishers, old
MIG gas canisters, etc.), the solution presented itself in a number of these
great whip canisters. 

Much as the purple with a label is a beautiful colour, I wanted them to be
black to blend in with the rest of the chassis. An angle grinder with a steel
wire brush, and some spray paint later, and they look much better.

In terms of fittings, a number of false starts (through BSP and NPT fittings),
and a few Amazon returns later, I discovered that the fitting is an M10x1
thread. I found some tee pieces (as they need both an in and an out), and now
they're pretty much ready. An initial vacuum test (without the tee piece)
showed them holding a vacuum very well, holding at 15 inHg for more than 10
minutes before I got bored and emptied (or should that be filled?) them.

And in black, looking very sleek.
